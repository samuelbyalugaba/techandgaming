/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Tech And Gaming App
 * @version Prototype
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with an admin CMS.
 * All top-level collections (`games`, `blogPosts`, `tags`, `leaderboards`)
 * are secured to allow read access to everyone, but write access is restricted
 * to admin users only. Admin status is determined by the existence of a

 * document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is stored in top-level collections: `/games/{gameId}`,
 * `/blogPosts/{blogPostId}`, `/tags/{tagId}`, and `/leaderboards/{leaderboardId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to all collections to facilitate discovery.
 * - Write access (create, update, delete) is strictly limited to admin users.
 * - Admin status is determined by the existence of a document in the
 *   `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection, where the document ID is the user's UID.
 * - No data shape validation is performed in this prototype to allow for rapid
 *   iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Leaderboard documents include the `gameId`, avoiding dependency on the Game
 *   document for leaderboard data and simplifying authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public content (games, blog posts, tags, leaderboards) is stored in
 *   separate top-level collections, enabling simpler and more performant
 *   `list` operations without filtering.
