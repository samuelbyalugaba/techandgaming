/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Tech And Gaming App
 * @version Prototype
 *
 * @description
 * This ruleset enforces that a user must be signed in to read or write any data.
 * It does not yet implement fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is stored in top-level collections: `/games/{gameId}`,
 * `/blogPosts/{blogPostId}`, `/tags/{tagId}`, and `/leaderboards/{leaderboardId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Read and write access to any data requires user authentication.
 * - This is a baseline security measure; more specific rules can be added later.
